A robotic system using the Microkernel Architecture with plugin components. 

**Key Concepts:**

- **Plugin Registration:**
  - The core system dynamically registers and loads plugins during runtime.

- **Plugin Interfaces:**
  - Plugins adhere to specific interfaces defined by the core system, ensuring compatibility.

- **Isolation:**
  - Each plugin operates independently, isolated from others, preventing unintended interactions.

- **Centralized Control:**
  - The core system maintains centralized control over the robot's essential functionalities.
